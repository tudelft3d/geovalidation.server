<p>The validator, which uses the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/val3dity">val3dity</a> in the background, checks whether the 3D primitives (<strong>Solids</strong>, <strong>CompositeSurfaces</strong>, or <strong>MultiSurfaces</strong>)  are <em>geometrically</em> valid according to the international standard <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26012">ISO 19107:2003</a>. </p>

<p>It accepts as input any GML files (or one of the formats built upon it, such as CityGML), OBJ, OFF, and <a href="http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/1.5/doc/manual/manual006.html#ff_poly">POLY</a>.
It simply scans the file looking for the 3D primitives and validates these according to the rules in ISO19107 (all the rest is ignored). </p>

<p>For <strong>Solids</strong>, the validation is performed hierarchically, ie first every polygon (embedded in 3D) is validated (by projecting it to a 2D plane and using <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/">GEOS</a>), then every shell is validated (must be watertight, no self-intersections, orientation of the normals must be consistent and pointing outwards, etc), and finally the interactions between the shells are analysed. 
This means that if a polygon of your solid is not valid, the validator will report that error but will <em>not</em> continue the validation (to avoid &#8220;cascading&#8221; errors). </p>

<p>For <strong>MultiSurfaces</strong>, only the validation of the polygons is performed, ie are they valid according to the 2D rules, and are they planar?</p>

<p>For <strong>CompositeSurfaces</strong>, the surface formed by the polygons must be a 2-manifold.</p>
