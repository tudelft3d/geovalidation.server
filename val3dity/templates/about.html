<p>The validator, which uses the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/tudelft-gist/val3dity">val3dity</a> in the background, checks whether the 3D primitives (<strong>gml:Solid</strong> or <strong>gml:MultiSurface</strong>) stored in a GML file are <em>geometrically</em> valid according to the international standard <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26012">ISO 19107:2003</a>. Any GML files, or one of the formats built upon it (such as CityGML), can be used as input. The validator simply scans the file looking for the <strong>gml:Solid</strong> or <strong>gml:MultiSurface</strong> tags and validates these (all the rest is ignored). It assumes that the input XML is syntactically valid according to the XSD of GML.</p>

<p>The validation is performed hierarchically, ie first every polygon (embedded in 3D) is validated (by projecting it to a 2D plane and using <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/">GEOS</a>), then every shell is validated (must be watertight, no self-intersections, orientation of the normals must be consistent and pointing outwards, etc), and finally the interactions between the shells are analysed. This means that if a polygon of your solid is not valid, the validator will report that error but will <em>not</em> continue the validation (to avoid &#8220;cascading&#8221; errors). For <strong>gml:MultiSurfaces</strong>, only the validation of the polygons is performed.</p>

<p>These <a href="{{  url_for("errors")  }}">errors</a> can be reported.</p>

<p>Most of the details of the implementation are available in this scientific article:</p>
