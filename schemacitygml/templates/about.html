<p>The web-application simply validates a CityGML file against its XSD schemas.
All the schemas of CityGML (v0.4, v1.0 and v2.0) are supported.</p>

<p>If there are errors, only the first one is reported. </p>

<p>If you encounter a bug, please report it on the <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/CityGML-schema-validation/issues">issue page</a>. </p>
