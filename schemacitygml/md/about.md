The web-application simply validates a CityGML file against its XSD schemas.
All the schemas of CityGML (v0.4, v1.0 and v2.0) are supported.

If there are errors, only the first one is reported. 

If you encounter a bug, please report it on the [issue page](https://github.com/tudelft3d/CityGML-schema-validation/issues).
