Welcome to CityGML Version 0.4.0. This directory contains
the XML schema files for CityGML, including referenced
schemas (GML, xAL), and some small example city models. 

The subdirectory "NoiseADE" contains the CityGML Noise ADE,
an application specific extension to include information
for noise dispersion simulation. It is used in the
implementation of the European Commission's directive
on the mapping and reduction of environmental noise.
See the CityGML website for more information.

CityGML is developed by the Special Interest Group 3D of
